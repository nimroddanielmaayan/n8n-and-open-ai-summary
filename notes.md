# n8n Summary

## General

### General Information - n8n and Automations

- n8n might be a "gold rush" for a while. So it's something that can make a lof
  of money in the short term, but will become very common and "comoditized" in
  the long run

- Therefore, speed is of the essence

- My n8n platform URL: <https://mayandigital.app.n8n.cloud/>

- Workflow templates: <https://n8n.io/workflows>

- (check more WhatsApp "example workflows" - this is the most common client
  request. Maybe even create an entire "WhatsApp workflows" portfolio)

- Currently, it looks like there's no way to link to a "public portfolio" or to
  individual workflows. The only way to show the portfolio to potential clients
  is using screen share or video capture

## n8n Basics

### Keeping Things Organized

- In order to keep things organized, it might be a good idea to name projects
  like this: "Client Name: Project Name"

- Internal projects (like my portfolio) should have a client name of "Internal"

# n8n Summary

## General

### General Information - n8n and Automations

- I am currently working on this tutorial: <https://youtu.be/u7ktVHkd8DI>, I
  already set up payments to OpenAI

- I want to create one "Nimrod Bot" workflow that will use WhatsApp, and one
  that will use a "public" web chat window, so that potential clients can
  interact with it themselves. This bot needs to include at least one "tool",
  like offering the user to send an email to me. More complex tool calls can be
  added later, like scheduling a meeting with me, etc

- Reminder - the assistant needs to be notified about the tools that it can run,
  (like send an email), and when it needs to run them, in its system
  instructions

- n8n recently added a "Data Table" node, which is like Google Sheets, but
  native

- The next thing that I have to do for "Nimrod Bot" is to write a PDF with
  questions and answers, to upload to the OpenAI Platform

- n8n might be a "gold rush" for a while. So it's something that can make a lof
  of money in the short term, but will become very common and "comoditized" in
  the long run

- Therefore, speed is of the essence

- My n8n platform URL: <https://mayandigital.app.n8n.cloud/>

- Workflow templates: <https://n8n.io/workflows>

- (check more WhatsApp "example workflows" - this is the most common client
  request. Maybe even create an entire "WhatsApp workflows" portfolio)

- Currently, it looks like there's no way to link to a "public portfolio" or to
  individual workflows. The only way to show the portfolio to potential clients
  is using screen share or video capture

- There are templates and tutorials for virtually every type of workflow and
  automation... So I can create an example for any kind of project that a
  potential client might want

- n8n is short for "nodemation", which basically means "automation using nodes"

## n8n Basics

### Keeping Things Organized

- In order to keep things organized, it might be a good idea to name projects
  like this: "Client Name: Project Name"

- Internal projects (like my portfolio) should have a client name of "Internal"

- The "define using AI" option is useful, when the information that needs to be
  passed between nodes is dynamic and not known in advance

## Tool Calling

### Tool Calling Basics

- Code tools - these can be used, for example, to remove annotations from a PDF
  response, and so on

## Assistants

### Assistants Basics

- Remember - assistants need to be notified about the tools that they can run,
  and when they need to run them. This is done in the assistant's system
  instructions

## Testing

### Testing Basics

- Always test before shipping to production!

- n8n has nice testing tools
